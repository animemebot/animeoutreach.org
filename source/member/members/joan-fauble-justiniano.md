I was born and raised in Ohio, USA, and became a Christian when I was 21.

I studied theatre at Miami University, and later earned a Bachelor of Arts in Bible from Lancaster Bible College.

My husband and I moved our young family to Japan to serve as missionaries in 1995, and in addition to leading Bible studies, I began directing high school and middle school productions - both dramas and musicals - at Christian Academy in Japan in 1999. 

I raised four children and am now a happy grandma of 3 grandchildren.
