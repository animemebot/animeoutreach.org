I was born in Ohio in the United States and was raised by a Christian family. My whole life was centered around church and my faith had become something that was just apart of my everyday. Though my faith hadn't become truly mine until I was about 19 years old.

I struggled with anxiety and depression and I hid it from everyone and I tried to hide it from God. I wanted to try and fix it myself or ignore it completely.

There was one specific night I remember where everything changed. I was having a nightmare and I woke myself up, I was scared and shaking. Then, "lean not on your own understanding" from Proverbs 3:5 flashed through my head and I was immediately calmed.

Once I understood that God was fully in control of all things, I let go. I gave all my fear and anxiety and sadness to Him and He made it disappear.

Now, I do my best to live my life dedicated to Him and His will for my life. I want to help people who have struggled like I have. I want to show that there is a love out there greater than any other that can heal all wounds. I have dreamed about writing a Christ centered anime since I was 12 and I am so grateful to be apart of this team.



My favorite animes ; Noragami, Full Metal Alchemist, Samurai Champloo, Erased, Soul Eater, anything by Hayao Miyazaki and many more!
